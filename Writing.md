# Halloween has evolved from an ancient ritual about death and the afterlife into a commercial celebration of costumes, parties and consumerism. Do you think this transformation represents cultural loss or cultural evolution?

The question displayed here is a wonderful one and makes you wonder how much the passage of time has changed the way we live, and how little we would relate with our ancestors if we went back a substantial amount of time.

That, in any case, doesn't change my opinion on this subject. For me, this cultural festivity, and any other that is still relevant and hasn't disappeared completely, has undergone a cultural evolution, and never a loss, and let me explain why this is the case.

Anything is subject to change, so in order for Halloween to keep existing it had to change eventually. It applies to anything, but, although that is bound to happen, it doesn't mean the old ways disappear. Nowadays you can see people commemorating what Halloween was and we have records of it so it never ends up forgotten, meanwhile, the new and modern Halloween is celebrated. So both versions of that festivity coexist with each other, as would happen with any other cultural thing.

It's not for me to question if the new, more popular Halloween is better or worse than the original one, but if you despise the current one you can always reminisce about the good old days, that is why I don't believe in cultural phenomena changes being a loss, because the older version will always be there.
